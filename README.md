![example workflow](https://github.com/victoryang00/Delight/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

Try to implement all the function in Hacker's Delight and make them runnable in [ckb_vm](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm).

Hacker's Delight is one of the famous book in cryptography tailoring to the architecture. Every Instruction count for encryption and decryption. To make the algorithm run nice and sound in virtual machine and get the gas in it is definite a good tool to learn smart contract and computer architecture.
