The states correspond to mappings, with state A denoting the map from
binary 00 to 00, 01 to 01, 10 to 11, and 11 to 10, and similarly for
states B, C, and D.
   To use the table, start in state A.  Scan the bits of s in pairs from
left to right.  The first row means that if the current state is A and
the currently scanned bits of s are 00, then output 00 and enter state
B.  Then, advance to the next two bits of s.  The third row means that
if the current state is A and the scanned bits are 10, then output 11
and stay in state A.
   If the outputs are accumulated in left-to-right order, then when the
end of s is reached, the output quantity will contain x in the odd
numbered bit positions, and y in the even numbered bit positions.  For
example, suppose

                              s = 110100.

Then since the process starts in state A and the initial bits scanned
are 11, the process outputs 10 and enters state D (fourth row).  Then,
being in state D and scanning 01, the process outputs 01 and stays in
state D.  Lastly, the process outputs 11 and enters state C, although
the state is now immaterial.
   Thus the output is 100111.  From the odd and even bits respectively,
this gives x = 101 and y = 011.  Thus the (x, y) coordinates for s = 52
(110100) are (5, 3). */

Given the "order" n of a Hilbert curve and a distance s along the curve,
this program computes the corresponding (x, y) coordinates.  The square
that the Hilbert curve traverses is of size 2**n by 2**n.
   The method is that given in [Lam&Shap], described by the following
table.  Here i = n-1 for the most significant bit of x and y, and i = 0
for the least significant bits.

To use this table, start at the least significant two bits of s (i = 0).
If they are both 0 (first row), set the least significant bits of x and
y to 0 and 0 respectively, and interchange x and y.  The last two
columns designate an interchange of the bits of x and y to the right of
bit i, but on this first iteration they are null, so there is no
interchange to do.  If the least significant two bits of s are 10 (third
row), set the least significant bits of x and y to 1, and similarly for
the other rows.
   Then, consider the next least significant two bits of s, and select
the appropriate row of the table to determine the next bits of x and y,
and how to change the bits of x and y to the right of i.  Continue until
the most significant bits of x and y have been processed. */
